# Parking App for Real-Time Knowledge (PARK)

PARK is a full-stack software solution designed to provide real-time parking availability data. The system leverages YOLO-based machine learning for object detection, enabling it to accurately identify open and occupied parking spots. The data is processed in real-time and displayed through a user-friendly online application, helping users find available parking efficiently.

By reducing time spent searching for parking, PARK aims to improve mobility, decrease frustration, and reduce unnecessary carbon emissions caused by vehicles circling for spots. This project showcases advanced machine vision techniques in a practical, real-world application, offering a scalable model that could be expanded to larger parking environments in the future.
